# Phase 1 Project: "Select your D&D Class"

## Description
This project was created for Flatiron School's Phase 1 project assignment. It takes a dropdown menu and a night mode button. You select a class and it displays information based on it.

## Usage
In the dropdown, you select a class, then the software appears with a picture and a description of your class's abilities. The dropdown starts empty but allows for a different selection. 
On the night mode button, just click it and it changes the background color and font to something more eye-pleasing, a dark background with white text.
